# Automation Testing
This is my first project in Selenium!
Our teacher gave us individually, I have tested demoblaze.

I have divided into different parts. I used Page Object model to help me work more easily
I divided to the following pages:
Home page, Contact Us, About-us page,Login sign up, Cart pages 
# Tests:
My tests were divided according to the pages I had to test 
and also according to the division into Functional,Useability and UI
# Tools:
In this project I used Pytest, Selenium,Requests, Allure
The Bonus was to execute The tests from Jenkins.
I add Sanity  when there is change in the project this builds run automatically.
